## About the Problem
The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet

Problems from this dataset
1. Ignore the test.csv Dataset, It doesn't have the same features as the Train.csv
2. The Train.csv has a lot of features remember to remove some of the features
3. Don't forget to Scale the Dataset and convert the object dtypes to one dtype --Shown on the code walkthrough
4. Since the Test.csv is not applicable, You can use the Train.csv as both the test data and train data. Though the dataset will be small and so expect overfitting.

Goodluck, and Happy coding
